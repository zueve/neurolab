"""
NeuroLab - a library of basic nueral networks algorithms with flexible network 
configurations and learning algorithms. To simplify the using of the library, 
interface is similar to the package of Neural Network Toolbox (NNT) of 
MATLAB (c). The library is based on the package numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org), 
some learning algorithms are used scipy.optymyze (http://scipy.org).
